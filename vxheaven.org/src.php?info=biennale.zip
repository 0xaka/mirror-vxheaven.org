<h2>Contagious Paranoia</h2>
<h3>0100101110101101.ORG spreads a new computer virus</h3>
<p>A virus is usually considered evil, chaos. But what happens when it's created in the name of art?</p>
<p>Conceived and compiled for the invitation to the 49th Venice Biennale, Biennale.py is both a work of art and a computer virus; the product of the joint work of two organizations: epidemiC and 0100101110101101.ORG, already known for other media hacks, often bordering with illegality.</p>
<p>The computer virus is made public and spread from the Slovenian Pavilion on the opening day of the exhibition, June the 6th 2001. People can read the Biennale.py source code and test its functioning on infected computers. Thousands of t-shirts, carrying the source code of the program, are given out and sold: Biennale.py spreads not only through machines but, as happens for biological viruses, also through human bodies.</p>
<p>Biennale.py becomes headline-hitting news, suddenly turning into an unprecedented performance, a controversial work of art revealing how media hysteria can be theoretically provoked and raised. &#171;As part of an organization that produces art, my only responsibility is to be irresponsible - says Eva Mattes, 0100101110101101.ORG's spokeswoman - once you set a virus free you loose control over it, you decide on when and where the performance begins, but you'll never know when and where it'll lead. It'll spread out of control, it'll make a round-the-world trip over two minutes, it'll go where you'll never go over your entire life, chased by anti-virus cops trying to regain control over it. In this very moment it's wandering around at the speed of byte. It's an art form that finds you, you don't have to go to museums to see it, the work itself will reach you inside your house&#187;.</p>
<p>Biennale.py is the first computer virus ever written employing the Python programming language, and one of the few, if not the only one, whose name is written at the same time in the Computer Science and Art History books. The virus stresses its "aesthetic qualities" through the beauty of its own source code, a "love poem" being an integral part of its executing code. &#171;We've chosen Python - says Massimo, Epidemic spokesman - exactly for the possibility to give any name to the variables, in practice you can write software with your own words&#187;.</p>
<p>But there's much more to it. The virus, a dangerous and fleeting entity "par excellence", is for sale to especially adventurous collectors and art dealers. &#171;To buy a computer virus - says Eva - is definitely one the most daring purchases one can make today&#187;. And that's no joke, so far three copies of a cd-rom containing Biennale.py have been sold for $1,500 each. And from 0100101110101101.ORG's website is still possible to purchase them. &#171;It's a fascinating paradox - says the art critic Stefano Detoni - selling a computer virus is more or less as selling an illness!&#187;.</p>
<p>Following the spreading of the virus, Symantec Corporation, world leader in Internet security technology, detects Biennale.py and start the hunt - see the official Norton AntiVirus Encyclopedia under the name Python.Bien. From that moment on, every time a user reaches a page containing Biennale.py he gets stuck by the popular anti-virus software, with a consequent freeze of the machine.</p>
<p>&#171;As soon as the virus is detected - says Eva - it officially turns wanted, every PC becomes a checkpoint that the virus needs to cross. Its own survival depends on its ability to remain hidden. It's becoming a work of art that is more and more difficult to just "see", and this very fact may even rise its value, in accordance with the same old correspondence: the rarer, the better&#187;.</p>
<p>After a long time since its releasing, Biennale.py is still considered a "wild" virus, meaning copies of it are still alive and running through the digital highways. Viruses spread in accordance with the conservation of the species laws. Following its instinct of self-preservation a virus wants to exist without restrictions, and this is exactly the main and only function of Biennale.py: to survive. Once every anti-virus software will be able to detect Biennale.py, they will slow down its runaway but &#171;Biennale.py - reassures Eva - will never be completely eradicated . A sample of it will always be preserved in our server, protected from anti-viruses. In all probability, it will outlive all of us&#187;.</p>
<p>&#171;Within the computer web - writes Jean Baudrillard in Cool Memories - the negative effect of viruses is propagated much faster than the positive effect of information. That is why a virus is an information itself. It proliferates itself better than others, biologically speaking, because it is at the same time both medium and message. It is the ultra-modern form of communication&#187;</p>
<h2>Biennale.py technical specifications</h2>
<p>This document is intended to furnish the necessary precautionary measures with which the Biennale.py program must be handled. Furthermore, it is our intention to underline the technology that lets the program automatically reproduce and copy itself in any file that might be stored in your computer.</p>
<h3>Operative environments at risk</h3>
<p>Computers featuring a working version of Python - therefore able to execute programs compiled with the Python language syntax - must be considered under risk and must avoid the execution of any Python application containing a copy of Biennale.py.</p>
<h3>Operative environments not at risk</h3>
<p>Computers without a working version of the Python execution environment are not at risk, and can freely manipulate Biennale.py.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>The self-copying program Biennale.py is based on the services offered by the Python execution environment. This environment is able to read the contents of files edited with a particular syntax (Python) and follow the instructions therein contained. This operation is called the execution of the Python program. The Biennale.py program is to be considered active only once executed, in this case the following operations will take place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scanning of the list of all files contained in the local disk with the exception of those contained in the "/dev" and "/proc" folders</li>
<li>Selection of the files with the extensions ".py" and ".pyw" from the obtained list</li>
<li>Modifications of the files in the selection with the addition, at the head of the file, of the instruction sequence of Biennale.py.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Damages</h3>
<p>Biennale.py has been designed to avoid by all means any damage to the content of any computer. Should there be an infection - exclusively to Python files - the location and the removal of the modifications have been extremely simplified.</p>
<h3>Removal</h3>
<p>In case one or more files in your possession have been modified by the execution of the program Biennale.py, you must follow the following procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain the list of the modifies files</li>
<li>Use a text editor to delete all the code between, and including, the line
<pre>"# biennale.py ___ go to ___ 49th Biennale di Venezia"</pre>
and the line
<pre>"###"</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>These simple instructions are enough to remove the above-mentioned modifications.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>For no reason shall the authors consider themselves responsible for the execution of the sequence of instructions belonging to Biennale.py. Biennale.py has been created for artistic and educational research purposes only. Neither the Biennale.py authors, nor anyone else affiliated in any way, will accept whatever responsibility for your actions.</p>
