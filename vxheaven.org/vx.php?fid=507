<p><a name="intro"></a>In the beginning... there was ,strong>void</strong>... And the void exploded in a wheel of fire and thousands of pieces of dust began to gather together. And melted by fire and blown by the winds the dust became stronger and stronger and bigger and bigger. And then, from within the forming rocks, wires of hot boiling water began to blast out with a terible noise. And the water mixed with the dust and a dark brown matter began to came to life and soround the hot rocks. And little by little a small round form appeared in what not so long ago was a big black void...</p>
<p>...And after that, the boy sqeezed the black ball of dirt in his hand and, with a quick smile lighting on his face, he bent a little, rolled his hand around a few times and throw the mud ball away... The window became thousands of glasses and the old lady came out screaming and holding a big stick: "I'm gonna get you, you bastard"...</p>
<p>"No, you're not," replayed the boy...</p>
<p>And suddenly he was a boy no more... He was a big giant looking down at the old frightened woman.</p>
<p>"No you're not!! Because <strong>I am the Power</strong>! And I hold the world to my feet now! And nobody will never, ever tell ME what to do anymore!!"</p>
<p>And with a quick step the giant foot felt on the old womans head...</p>
<p>"Look...", said the young boy, "a poster with an old woman!!"</p>
<p>This little intro, sci-fi like, dream like, or whatever you want like doesn't mean I usualy like to sqeeze old women under my feet. It was supposed to be, well, as a metaphor or something... I would let you to discover the meaning by yourself, but this would mean at least a hundred meanings, so I will explain it myself. This is the short presentation of the little boy's inner feelings. Whenever we are little, we want to be big. The smaller we are, the more we want the world to be at our feet. The bigger we grow we start to understand that... hell, the life is still gonna be over one day, wether you owned the world or not. And as soon as we do something really bad, we want to be kids again, so the biggest punishment would be one week grounding.</p>
<p>Then we come to computers... Ehhh... computers. Nice word. The home computer is a way of achieving, at least partially, some of our dreams and thoughts. And what better way of actually doing it can there be than allowing the world to see you? None! All you need is a computer, a cable to connect you to the Net and a cheap ISP. And then... you <strong>have</strong> to act!! Having the Internet around and not acting would be like keeping a bottle of beer in the house more than one hour without drinking it ;-)</p>
<p>I hope you understand where I am driving to... After this little "why are we doing this" kind of presentation, let me tell you who is doing this.</p>
<p>I am so glad of finaly being able to <strong>act</strong>! This time by issuing this VX related e-zine where I hope you will find some useful information.</p>
<p>Unfortunately (I'll tell you why), I, Lord Julus, am writing this by my own. I say unfortunately because I really like the team work. I don't want any of you to think: "hey, here's another &lt;I do it all> guy"... No, that's not it... The problem is that it looks like the vx scene is really, really, really fucked up, as no one is willing to ACT anymore... Well, I did and this is what came out. If you like it, I am glad. If you don't, you know your delete commands. Let me brief you about how this came out...</p>
<p>One year ago I joined the SLAM group at the kind invitation of my good friend VirtualDaemon. By that time the SLAM group was completely moved to asm from macro and had already 4 issues out. I joined exactly when the entire scene was moving fast towards win32 programming. I must say I had an excelent time in SLAM. VD created a mailing list where we spoke many times and shared many ideas. I must say all the guys were absolutely great. You might ask why did I move and tried to publish my own zine? Because I wanted to be boss? No way!! The actual reason is that most of the guys in SLAM, including VD were in their final years and moving to colleges. This put SLAM in a dormant state, but not disbanded as some rumors were heard. This was combined with the fact that this year I felt like I was at the top of my activity. I don't know if it will last too long, so I decided that I cannot wait another year for another issue of SLAM, so I tried to form a new group. Unfortunately, again, I wasn't able to find active people ready to get into action. That's why I decided to release this, even if it could be my final stuff. Though, I'd hate to see the first stuff being also the last stuff...</p>
<p>The name of the group came to me suddenly, without any link to anything. Just "Virus Extasy" maybe, which became "Vx-tasy".</p>
<p>Also, please note that from the beginning I wanted this issue to be the very first win32 only vx e-zine. When I write this there exists no win32 only vx e-zine, but until I really release the stuff it might come out. So, basically in this e-zine I will take win32 from bottom to top and from all points of view which ever interested me. It could look poor to you as I did it all by myself, but this is the most I can do all alone. However I think there is some nice stuff inside. Please note that I also included my old win32 articles, with some mild modification. No, I didn't do it to annoy you, but it simply looked ok to me as to make a complete win32 virus writing guide. Please note that *this* is the official release of these articles, as my WEB page is purely an informative area, and which also got zapped due to it's so called anti-social content... Bullshit! ;-))</p>
<p>So, I guess that would be the thing about us. Note that I say "us" as I hope that in the future I will be able to gather some other people around and create a powerful group. I am thinking about a team of around five people, but we shall see what the future brings us.</p>
<p>Also, you might wonder why a win32 only e-zine is presented into a Dos only environment. Well... call it conservatorism... I still have to say that I like more what you can achieve using the Dos text mode, more than the clasical Windows faces. Besides, the short time didn't allow me to write a Win32 viewer, even if it is more than simple... Maybe next time, or maybe never ;-) (I like being dramatic, don't I? ;-))</p>
<p>Some more notes, now... Please nottice that this issue is more on the tutorial side. I wasn't able to write more than one new virus for you and this is all because of the lack of time. However, I think you may find many interesting things in the tutorial I wrote. The presence of my older win32 viruses in this issue is purely for their perpetuation. My WEB page might be erased any moment and I wanted these babies to live in a friendly environment, e.g. an electronical zine...</p>
<p>And at last, but not at least: if you have any comments, critics, whatever, please feel free to fill in the survey and send it over to me...</p>
