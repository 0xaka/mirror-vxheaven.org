<h2><a name="intro"></a>How Did Cris Start, Where Is It Going?</h2>
<h3>The story From The Beginning</h3>
<p>Cris hatched out of a virus concept, I, The sysop of the Cris BBS first started running a bbs in 1989. This was a shareware bbs running on an XT 8088 machine with a 65 meg hard disk. I still remember the fear that I had for virus from back then.</p>
<p>I remember one day a user logged on and posted an ad requesting viruses, he came about this in a nice way, and explained that these viruses he got would be used for research reasons only, they would not be given to anyone, and they would be used ONLY on a machine set aside for this reason.</p>
<p>It took me about two minutes to take his account off the bbs and delete his message. This fear was in me for these things. I remember thinking back of telling one of my friends when the topic of scanning for virus came up, that if I ever came up with one, I would never trust a scanner to clean it, but would format my hard disk! Even then I was not sure if this would be enough, I might need to buy a new computer.</p>
<p>This fear that some (not all) AV people put in our minds is still out there. (The Michael Angelo virus was a good example of that.)</p>
<p>In 1991 I was over at a fellow sysops home, he had a small collection of viruses, and unzipped one into a directory, I stood there with amazement as he scanned with the latest version of scan. His computer did not blow up!, it detected the virus, then he ran the clean, and the virus was gone! I was amazed that he could do this on his computer (unzip a virus) and not trash one thing. That night I took those viruses home with me.</p>
<p>I began testing them, ie: unzipping and running them on my computer. They did not damage my computer. It began to be fun to see what they could do, and see if i could contain them from my other files, once in awhile one would infect one of my dos files or some other file in the computer, but i would just delete, clean or replace it! No harm done! (read a research guide before doing this yourself).</p>
<p>I began to advertize for viruses :), I became bored with the ones I had and wanted to see what was out there. I started experimenting with trojans, memory resident files and some stealth files. It took a long time before I began to meet people where I could get the ready access to them, but there was enough around that it kept me busy. Groups that I always heard of seemed far away, I could only dream of coming into contact with NUkE, Phalcon/Sk, or other groups around then.</p>
<p>I had an area on the BBS where I had virus files, but this was like the normal viruses I had, to that point in time. three hundred files at the most. Then one day I heard that the group nuke was local here in the Chicago area, and at about the same time I saw a bbs ad on advertizing nukenet. I called the number on the advertizement and applied for the access. It was about two days latter I heard back from them. It seems that i did this at the right time, the chicago board was not able to connect to their hub to get their mail from Canada or the US.</p>
<p>I was offered to hub the net for Nuke so Nowhere man, one of the main programmers for nuke (for those that do not know) could get his mail. I jumped at the opportunity! So here I was, Green to all of the politics, not knowing what was really going on in either world, reading the nuke administration bases, seeing how they worked, what they were doing from the inside out. Also at this time I started talking to people allot on the phone, ie (big bills), calling Nuke members and others voice really opened my eyes as to what was going on in the AV & VX worlds. If those people gave out diplomas I would have graduated with flying colors, and the phone bills I got would have paid my way through collage.</p>
<p>The politics in the group really made me grow weary of what was going on. There was allot of things going on in the group that was not legal, there were people in there that were trying to fix it, but for the most part in the end it seemed to be something that could not be fixed. I began to tell these people that I was leaning more toward the AV side and views on things. They thought this was ok, as long as I did not cross certain boarders. like for example, talking to caro members, the whole idea here was to get in to it a little bit, but not all the way. In time I was told that AV people could not be trusted, and to stay away from them. They were all liars and deceivers. "They are going to stick it up your ass"!</p>
<p>Well I will never tell anyone that, but there are people in any group that are like that. I am always watching my back (from both sides). To make this long story a little shorter, I started talking to people like Sara Gorden. (this person is great for not really taking a side in a conversation) She just told me straight out what was going on in her eyes, well this helped allot to see more of what was going on, and believe me I have spent many hours thinking this thing out.</p>
<p>It was not long before I began to see that this situation had no resting place, there was no middle ground, it was either black or white. you are either AV or VX! This might be why so many people were so confused for so long. Also this added more fire to both sides, now their are spies, moles, etc. when you are on an AV board you are AV and when you are on a VX board you are VX.</p>
<p>So it is true, there is not really a term `VX' for the nuke type groups, but who am I to change that, this is their war, not mine. But anyone can see that allot of the AV out there do VX (Virus Exchange), but this is only among themselves. But the fact is still there, allot do vx and sometimes the files get around to the nasty part of this VXing realm, No one is perfect, sooner or latter down the thread the files that the `AV' share will end up in the hands of the ones that they shun and send away. Yes I also have files with AV authors signatures in them also.</p>
<p>So some Av are Vx'ers, funny when you see this. Well this is the way I have seen it, This all comes down to an individual thing. Some of the people in the VX world (as we know it) are not bad people, they do not do damage to peoples machines nor do they like to see it done. But these same people want to exercise their right to have and hold their virus collection, or play with their viruses in the privacy of their own home. Tell me that there are no AV people out there that have fun playing with viruses. There are many I am sure that enjoy tracing a file through memory, and just the plain old challenge of beating it.</p>
<p>So why should we deny someone else of this `fun'? What gives one person the right to tell another that I can have this and play with it but you cannot! This reminds me of a selfish kid wanting to have all of the toys to himself. There are other things coming into play here, there is an ELITE group here called AV, they only exchange among their circles. In other words one AV `Click' will share around themselves, while another will not. It is a hard life to live (this AV thing), if you want to test viruses you either get them from your friends in the AV, or from a mole, or a VX board out there.</p>
<p>I have heard several AV talk about the other AV person, saying "oh that person, I would never give him a virus". but this is a friend, echoing in the same AV nets, doing the same research, but not in that personal pedicular `Click'. This is a shame if you ask me. But what this all comes down to is the fact that there are people all over that want to research, collect, play, etc... If these people cannot fit into a click somewhere, they will more than likely end up on a (termed) VX bbs somewhere. Is this where they belong? (I do not think so)</p>
<p>Now there are some misconceptions that I have seen, AV people have rumored what VX boards are like.</p>
<h3>Some AV Mis-Conceptions about (termed) VX Boards</h3>
<ol>
<li>ALL VX boards are boards where all the users use handles (alias names).</li>
<li>ALL of the VX'ers are people that are looking to destroy your data or crash your computer.</li>
<li>ALL VX'ers are doing things against the law, ie Hacking, Phreaking, Carding, PBX'ing, Making Bombs or teaching people to do so, the list goes on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, it is true that allot of these boards are promoting such things, but Cris does see that not all on these boards are into illegal things like the above, but the AV as we know it today must share some of the blame for what is going on in there. Yes, for every person that they did not welcome into their `click' that went their way into the VX scene. now these people are going the only other way that is left, if they want to have these files for themselves.</p>
<p>There are some in the VX world of things now that DO NOT want to do damage to anyone's machine, they will not even give a virus to someone that says that they will. Allot of these people change after a while into a full pleaded nuk'em type person after a while. My grandmother used to say, "if you play with poo poo, your going to stink", and this is what happens, someone with morals hangs around long enough, they will loose these morals after a while.</p>
<p>So after seeing all of this, I and others that saw the same thing, started A group called Cris. (Computer Research and Information Service).</p>
<p>Cris sees this middle ground very clear. We are very AV, or AVvX, if you will. Here are some short Cris definitions of the way cris sees the politics of the thing.</p>
<p>The problem here is that there are allot of VX people that do not fit into this AV `Click' but still have the "proper ethics". They have no intention of doing any damage or giving the files to people who do. They are VX, because they exchange viruses (just as the AV do), but they are people with "proper ethics" (AVvX)</p>
<dl>
<dt>AV'ers</dt><dd>Someone that is against viruses doing damage to someone's machine, against anyone that would attempt to bring about this act, against anyone that would help aid a person in this act. Someone that will assist others in the prevention of this act (ie: AV software).</dd>
<dt>AVvX'ers</dt><dd>All of the above + Will virus exchange with any interested person that is to be trusted (in their eyes), AV authors, programmers, researchers, collectors. But not clear cases of un-ethical people.</dd>
<dt>VX'ers</dt><dd>None of the above. Their work is to undermine AV research and programming, they will assist people attempting to damage systems, no ethics apply here. Not all but many of these users are hackers/phreakers/carders, most of this group has no respect for the law and tend to have an `underground' way of thinking.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Remember, Virus exchange is not against the law (YET), AV'ers and AVvX'ers do not want to see this happen, very few in the av group want to see this happen, most of them are taking a stand against it. (we'll know more on this after the upcoming hearings...) Only a select few are pushing for it. we see these as AV_CONFUSED!</p>
<dl>
<dt>AV_Confused</dt><dd>Those individuals in the AV community who want to make it illegal to own and exchange viruses (or virus code), UNLESS you are an "approved researcher".</dd>
</dl>
<p>The questions that remain unanswered are: Approved by who? What criteria would one have to meet? As long as viruses are clearly labeled as such, who has the right to tell anyone (in a democratic society) what kind of code they may, or may not, keep on their own personal computer? The only thing that will happen if viruses are made illegal is that the VX community will go deeper underground. The above are the reasons why we call the individuals that want to see viruses made illegal AV_CONFUSED, we fail to see the benefits of their plan. All we see is people wanting the Government to tell us what we may or may not possess on our personal computers. This sets a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>Cris has gone through allot of changes, Growing into what it is today. We have not finished yet, we are still growing. If you see an area that we need to grow in be sure to let us know. You will not be shunned or turned away, we are always looking to grow, and come closer to some truth or idea.</p>
<p>Here are some of the changes that have taken place.</p>
<blockquote>Access used to be allot easier then what it is now. It seemed that we started a little naive. Anyone that logged on the board and filled out a research application that looked ok we gave access to viruses right away. Now this has changed. It seemed that users were filling out research apps to get the viruses, Not really caring about research work. they just wanted to download. Now if someone fills out a research application, they will be assigned one virus to research at a time, until they become regular with the work.</blockquote>
<p>So for the most, things are changing, as we run into problems, always someone looking for a way to get something for nothing, weather it is free files without uploading, special privileges for being a research member, and doing no work, etc. We try to be more then fair with everyone, but there comes a time to smarten up, we do not take advantage of anyone and we feel that others should not try to do it here.</p>
<p>We have made it easier on collectors and people that just want to Collect. Before we neglected this area, we saw the research desire here, and neglected to see the honest collector that fit into this AVvX concept, so we have added it into the bbs. After being an `approved' collector, ie someone that is clearly a virus collector, can prove it, and someone that (in our eyes) is not a malicious person that will use the files in the wrong way, he will have access to a ratio of upload/download for virus files.</p>
<p>Crisnet has grown quite a bit also, this started as vinenet from the old Vine bbs, it was basically a warez net, with allot of boards echoing from around the USA and Canada, this net and the board were a jumping place, servicing allot of users, never enough time for all to do what they wanted, when the bbs and the net went to the AV concept we lost 80% of the net and users. But now in return we have been paid back with allot of new users and connections, AV people from all over the world have connected to this mail echo crisnet. You will find nodes from Africa (most of these with the AVvX concept), and AV nodes in Germany, Malta, Canada, and all over the USA, this is growing like wildfire.</p>
<h3>So Where Is Cris Going, And What Are Our Future Goals</h3>
<p>Cris is taking this "New Trend" in AVvX, all the way. We will stay out of the AV and VX world of confusion, mistrust, and politics. We will stick with our AVvX concept as long as the `AV' continues in the way it is going. Some day who knows maybe they will open up into this trusting scene and open their minds to some of the normal every day people out there that want to get involved and exercise their right to have any code they want on their own computer, (as long as these are ethical people).</p>
<p>Cris will continue putting out the Crisnews newsletter, We also have plans in the working of coming out with some AV products ourselves. One will be a complete anti-virus package, we will first start with a simple scanner though we have allot of ideas and feel that we will forge ahead and get these things done in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>We plan to give the crisnet to any bbs in the world that wants it. there are message areas in there now for both the AV, AVvX, and VX posting. Some handles are aloud (special cases) of virus programmers, sometimes AV researchers like to ask these virus programmers some questions and trying to find them with their real names could be a problem, so we allow KNOWN Virus programmers in the net with their aliases. Although we personally know the people, and have their real info, in the net this would serve them best to be who they have been, and go by the names that the world recognizes them as. Crisnet will continue to be an open forum to all alike. It will not matter what world you are coming from, you will have the right to express your view in a moderated forum. If anyone gets carried away (has not yet happened) the node will be removed from the echo.</p>
<p>Well for the most part this has been something hard to write. trying to cover all of the areas you might be wondering about is a task. If you have any other questions they might be better answered via netmail, you can get in touch with Cris in the following ways.</p>
<p>Netmail 1:115/863, Crisnet 77:708/0, or log on the bbs at 708-863-5285 you may fill out some on-line questioners, or download from the file area crisnet/info. magic words for freq-ing are as follows: filelist, nodelist, cris, and help. All of these are freqable if you are in the fidonet or crisnet nodelist. No virus or virus code can be freqed.</p>
