        <h4>Introduction to RFID Technology</h4>
        <hr>

        <p>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is the latest
        phase in the decades-old trend of the miniaturization of
        computers. RFID transponders are tiny resource-limited
        computers that do not have a battery that needs periodic
        replacement. RFID tags are inductively powered by their
        external reading devices, called RFID readers. Once the
        RFID tag is activated, the tag decodes the incoming
        query and produces an appropriate response by using the
	energy of the incoming radio wave to power the chip long
	enough to respond. RFID tags can do a limited amount of
        processing, and have a small amount (&lt;1024 bits) of
        storage.</p>

        <p>RFID tags are useful for a huge variety of applications.
        Some of these applications include: supply chain
        management, automated payment, physical access control,
        counterfeit prevention, airline baggage management,
	and smart homes and offices. RFID
        tags are also implanted in all kinds of personal and
        consumer goods, for example, passports, partially assembled
        cars, frozen dinners, ski-lift passes, clothing, EZ-Pass
	toll collection devices, and public
        transportation tickets. Implantable RFID tags for animals
        allow concerned owners to label their pets and livestock.
        Verichip Corp. has also created a slightly adapted
        implantable RFID chip, the size of a grain of rice, for use
        in humans. Since its introduction, the Verichip was
        approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and this
        tiny chip is currently deployed in both commercial and
        medical systems. A great deal of information is available
        on RFID technology. Some introductory Web pages are listed

        <h4>RFID Threats</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Unfortunately, businesses and governments are not the
        only ones interested in RFID. Civil liberties groups,
        hackers and criminals are also keenly interested in this
        new development, albeit for very different reasons. Civil
        liberties groups are concerned about RFID technology being
        used to invade people's privacy; RFID tags enable unethical
        individuals to snoop on people and surreptitiously collect
        data on them without their approval or even knowledge. For
        example, RFID-enabled public transit tickets could allow
        public transit managers to compile a dossier listing all of
        a person's travels in the past year -- information which
        may be of interest to the police, divorce lawyers, and
        others.</p>

        <p>However, privacy is not the focus of this website and
        will not be discussed further below. On the other hand, we
        are intensely concerned about privacy in an RFID-enabled
        world and have built an entire sister website about a
        device we have constructed, called the RFID Guardian, which
        could potentially help people protect their privacy from
        RFID snooping in the future. Those interested in RFID and
        privacy might want to check it out at <a href=
        "http://www.rfidguardian.org">www.rfidguardian.org</a>.
	The website even includes a video of the prototype RFID Guardian
	in action.
<!--
        That website also offers some <a href=
        "http://www.rfidguardian.org/text_resources.html">suggested
        readings</a> on the subject of RFID and privacy.</p>
-->
        <p>A completely different category of threats arises when
        hackers or criminals cause valid RFID tags to behave in
        unexpected (and generally malicious) ways. Typically,
        computer-bound or mobile RFID readers query RFID tags for
        their unique identifier or on-tag data, which often serves
        as a database key or launches some real-world activity. For
        example, when an RFID reader at a supermarket checkout
        counter reads the tag on a product, the software driving it
	could add the item scanned to the
        list of the customer's purchases, tallying up the total
        after all products have been scanned.</p>

        <p>Here is where the trouble comes in. Up until now,
        everyone working on RFID technology has tacitly assumed
        that the mere act of scanning an RFID tag cannot modify
        back-end software, and certainly not in a malicious way.
        Unfortunately, they are wrong. In our research, we have
        discovered that if certain vulnerabilities exist in the RFID
	software, an RFID tag can be (intentionally) infected with a virus
        and this virus can infect the backend
        database used by the RFID software. From there it can be
        easily spread to other RFID tags. No one thought
        this possible until now. Later in this website we provide
        all the details on how to do this and how to defend against
        it in order to warn the designers of RFID systems not to
        deploy vulnerable systems.</p>

        <p>While we have some hesitation in giving the "bad guys"
        precise information on how to infect RFID tags, it has been
        our experience that when talking to people in charge of
        RFID systems, they often dismiss security concerns as
        academic, unrealistic, and unworthy of spending any money
        on countering, as these threats are merely "theoretical."
        By making code for RFID "malware" publicly available, we
        hope to convince them that the problem is serious and had
        better be dealt with, and fast. It is a lot better to lock
        the barn door while the prize race horse is still inside
        than to deal with the consequences of not doing so afterwards.</p>

        <h4>Real-World Scenarios</h4>
        <hr>
        To make clear what kinds of problems might arise from RFID
        hacking by amateurs or criminals, let us consider three
        possible and all-too-realistic scenarios.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>A prankster goes to a supermarket that scans the purchases in its customers' shopping carts using the RFID chips affixed to the products instead of their bar codes. Many supermarkets have plans in this direction because RFID scans are faster (and in some cases can be done by the customers, eliminating the expense of having cashiers). The prankster selects, scans, and pays for a nice jar of chunk-style peanut butter that has an RFID tag attached to it. Upon getting it home, he removes or destroys the RFID tag. Then he takes a blank RFID tag he has purchased and writes a exploit on it using his home computer and commercially available equipment for writing RFID tags. He then attaches the infected tag to the jar of peanut butter, brings it back to the supermarket, heads directly for the checkout counter, and pays for it again. Unfortunately, this time when the jar is scanned, the virus on its tag infects the supermarket's product database, potentially wreaking all kinds of havoc such as changing prices.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
<p>Emboldened by his success at the supermarket, the prankster decides to unwittingly enlist his cat in the fun.  The cat has a subdermal pet ID tag, which the attacker rewrites with a virus using commercially available equipment.  He then goes to a veterinarian (or the ASPCA), claims it is stray cat and asks for a cat scan. Bingo! The database is infected. Since the vet (or ASPCA) uses this database when creating tags for newly-tagged animals, these new tags can also be infected. When they are later scanned for whatever reason, that database is infected, and so on. Unlike a biological virus, which jumps from animal to animal, an RFID virus spread this way jumps from animal to database to animal. The same transmission mechanism that applies to pets also applies to RFID-tagged livestock.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
<p>Now we get to the scary part. Some airports are planning to expedite baggage handling by attaching RFID-augmented labels to the suitcases as they are checked in.  This makes the labels easier to read at greater distances than the current bar-coded baggage labels. Now consider a malicious traveler who attaches a tiny RFID tag, pre-initialized with a virus, to a random person's suitcase before he checks it in. When the baggage-handling system's RFID reader scans the suitcase at a Y-junction in the conveyor-belt system to determine where to route it, the tag responds with the RFID virus, which could infect the airport's baggage database. Then, all RFID tags produced as new passengers check in later in the day may also be infected. If any of these infected bags transit a hub, they will be rescanned there, thus infecting a different airport. Within a day, hundreds of airport databases all over the world could be infected. Merely infecting other tags is the most benign case. An RFID virus could also carry a payload that did other damage to the database, for example, helping drug smugglers or terrorists hide their baggage from airline and government officials, or intentionally sending baggage destined for Alaska to Argentina to create chaos (e.g., as revenge for a recently fired airline employee).</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

Some companies with a vested interest in RFID technology have
said their software can withstand attacks such as the ones we
have proposed. We hope that is the case. These claims would
be much more believable, however, if the companies made their
software available to universities and other neutral parties for
exhaustive testing, along with a large reward (say, $100,000)
for the first person to construct a virus that successfully infects it.
If no one is able to infect the software after, say 6 months,
the claim that the software cannot be infected is a great
deal stronger than merely stating it without proof.
The nice part of this for the company is that if the software
is bulletproof, it costs the company nothing.

        <h4>Technical Details</h4>
        <hr>

        <p>By now the general outline of the problem should be
        clear: when an unsuspecting reader scans an infected tag,
        there is a danger of the tag exploiting a vulnerability in
	the middleware  to cause unwanted actions to occur, which may include
	infecting the database.
	Now it is time to go into more detail.
	The links below give more technical detail about possible attacks and
	how to prevent them. It is suggested that you read them in order.
