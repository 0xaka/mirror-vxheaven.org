<meta name="Description" content="Robert Slade: Suzana Celustka is part of the international virus research community. She became active in research while attending university in Prague, but comes originally from Croatia and is currently resident in Zagreb.  In 1993 she attempted to spur development of a proper definition of a viral program (which still eludes researchers and writers) by promoting a virus definition contest. (She did put a bit of life into the proceedings by calling for definitions not only in text and mathematical forms, but also jokes and poetry.)  The lack of success in this area will be familiar to workers in the field of  artificial life, who have had similar difficulties in delineating life.  As it  happens, this is another area of Ms. Celustka's interests, and in 1994 she  started &quot;Alive&quot; magazine, distributed electronically, in order to examine the  relation between computer viral programs and artificial life.  Two editions of the magazine have been published so far, with a third now in  process.  (The move back to Croatia and a period of ill health contributed to  the delay.)  &quot;Alive 0&quot; is stated to be the zeroth, or beta, edition, and  explains the background of the project.  It also contains the results of the  first contest the definition of a computer virus in the technical categories.   There are also articles on the &quot;lifelike&quot; characteristics of code for LAN token  regeneration and on Cohen's theorem of the &quot;undecidability&quot; of viral detection.  In &quot;Alive 1&quot;, Ms. Celustka contributes two articles herself, one on the nature and limitations of language (in regard to the problem of technical definition), and another on the &quot;Grand Debate&quot; about the benefits versus dangers of viral programs.  In addition to the feature and invited articles, each edition includes an interview with at least one (and usually more) researcher prominent in the field.  The participants in &quot;The Great Debate&quot;, for example, were Fred Cohen, Mark Ludwig and Vesselin Bontchev. The questions asked are incisive and insightful.  Alive represents very real explorations in both virus and artificial life  research.  The opinions and thought presented are sometimes radical departures  from mainstream discussion.  With careful moderation and editing, however,  there is no chance of the &quot;high noise/low signal&quot; traffic one usually sees in  many more well known fora.  Alive is highly recommended for any interested in  viral or artificial life studies."/>

<h2><a name="intro"></a>1. "ALIVE" next host to you (a word of introduction)</h2>
<p>Dear Readers!</p>
<p>I guess you are already impatient to find out what "Alive" is. Calm down till I tell you something about its history.</p>
<p>So, once upon a time...actually about a year ago I started a long search for the best definition of a computer virus. Surprisingly, it wasn't an easy task. Discussions on Virus-L and some private discussions didn't bring any satisfying results. I even started the Contest for the Best Virus Definition in despair. Well, the prizes were rather symbolic and probably it caused a low response. Never mind. All those attempts to answer the question : "What is a computer virus ?" only opened new questions. It appeared that computer viruses could be considered as members of a big family of so called "artificial life". Naturally, new questions were: "What is artificial life?", then "How to define a life?", etc.</p>
<p>This magazine is one more try to find answers to some questions. The search for the best definition of computer virus will be continued. It is a general opinion that computer viruses are inherently malicious software. The possibility of viruses to be beneficial will be (hopefully) discussed here. However, protection against malicious viruses will not be neglected. This magazine will try to introduce new ways of protection, e.g. "immune systems". The question "What can be 'alive' in a computer environment ?" will be repeated in all possible variations as long as wish to find answers exists. The examples or descriptions of "liveware" will be presented here as soon as they appear. Probably some new topics will arise as "Alive" progresses. And, of course, I expect a lot of fun for both readers and contributors.</p>
<h3>About this issue</h3>
<p>This is 0th issue or beta version of "Alive". It means - feel free to criticise every detail in it (in a civilized and constructive way, of course).</p>
<p>The first topic is presentation of results from Contest for the Best Virus Definition in technical categories. The Contest was announced in April last year on Virus-L. Originally it had 8 categories: 1. Technical definition in plain language, 2. Technical definition - mathematical, 3. Legislative definition, 4. Ethical definition, 5. Philosophical definition, 6. Poetical definition, 7. Funny definition and 8. Other definitions. The response was significant only in the first two categories and (surprisingly) in the poetical one.The jury for technical categories worked hard and the results of its voting are presented here. Regretfully, it will not be possible to publish many of the valuable comments that members of the jury gave during their work. I wish to thank the members of the jury again for their efforts and to all contributors to the Contest for their contributions.</p>
<p>The second topic is a kind of puzzle. It concerns one of the standard distributed algorithms which could be possibly considered as a sign of "life". The readers are asked to help to find a solution.</p>
<p>The third contribution is an article which is rewritten here without permission from something which looks like a copy of an internal document from Johannes Kepler University, Linz. I hope that one day I will find the author's address and that he will have nothing against publishing his article in "Alive". The article has a very interesting conclusion and I am not going to tell you anything in advance. Just read it!</p>
