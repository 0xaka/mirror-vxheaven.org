<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Impact" size="6">[ DCA's Home ]</font><p>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to DCA (Dark Coderz Alliance), hope you like
what we try to bring to all of you, if you don't know our MANIFEST then give
me some moments to give you a brief idea of what we are and what we do.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">First DCA was founded by me 'Sinclaire' and was
built with the help of my friends not members only but all the people who
supported us and promoted us *All Greetings To Them* and our plan was simple
give out new ideas, new techniques and new methods, snippets, libraries
anything which can help to others in their journey of the VX side also our
goal was to give out sources to Viruses/Worms for every level of coders not
only the advanced ones but the n00bes too ;) *Isn't that great or what* and
the idea was also not how complex we can code but what can we give to all of
you to learn and to actually benefit from *Don't You Just Love Me :)* and
also not the typical ASM work but any other languages that can actually
get the job done (i.e. Viruses/Worms) so we tried to
spread in every programming language and anything we saw that can make the
world not a better place ;) and also not for WIN platforms only but for *NIX
too :), and most thing that makes us different than others is that the
QUALITY is what we are concerned about not the QUANTITY, and also as everyone knows there aren't many active groups now in
the scene anyway here are the languages we support:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">Assembly (TASM/FASM/NASM)</font></li>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">C/C++</font></li>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">Delphi</font></li>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">Visual Basic</font></li>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">Visual Basic Scripts</font></li>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">Batch</font></li>
<li><font color="#FFFFFF">.NET (Very Soon...)</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">You can also find us in IRC, but you will have to
follow some rules in order to stay there those rules can be found
<a href="irc.html#Channel_Rules">here</a> also you can check out the list of
people who are actually in the DCA channel (#DCA) and friends to DCA too :) this list can be found
<a href="irc.html#Channel_List">here</a> too.</font><p>
<font color="#FFFFFF">[ Sinclaire's International VX Anthem ]</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Let me introduce myself, am a social disease<br>I come for
your welcome,
to leave you on your knees<br>No time for feel and sorry, I got hear on
my own<br> I won't ask for mercy, i choose to walk alone<br>What yours is mine and what's mine is mine too<br>
If you shake my hands
better count your fingers<br>What if i do get caught, what if there is
no judgment<br>If am right then i loose nothing, if you're right i loose it all<br>
Do
i gotta be caught, because am doing something wicked<br>Am guilty,
haunted by my fears, and let it all on consequences<br>
You built walls to protect you so no one will infect you<br>
Pursued by those out there, and vanish in thin air<br>
Come along way to find, what you really left behind <br>
You don't know when to end this but its coming fast<br>
What yours is mine and what mine is mine too<br>If you shake&nbsp;my hands
better count your fingers<br>What if i do get caught, what if there is
no judgment<br>If am right then i loose nothing, if you're right i loose it all<br>
Do i gotta get caught, because am doing something wicked<br>Am guilty
haunted by my fears, and let it all on consequences</font><p>
<font color="#FFFFFF">NOTE: This is not meant to be like a kind of
competition with others VX Groups or anything but i would like to change
some things around in here, and if you are the a good coder and already have
some work of your own and want to join contact me and i will see about it.</font></p>
