A review of their historical development and recent outbreaks leads to a number of observations. First, while viruses were more common than worms initially, worms have become the predominant threat in recent years, coinciding with the growth of computer networking. Second, despite widespread use of firewalls and other network security equipment, worm outbreaks still occur and will likely continue to be a threat for the near future. Third, recent worms are appearing as a series of quick successive variants. Unlike the independent efforts of early viruses, these variants suggest an increasing level of coordination among worm creators. Fourth, recent worms have shown capabilities to spread faster and exploit more infection vectors. This trend implies a more urgent need for automated, coordinated protection measures. Finally, more dangerous payloads are becoming commonplace. This suggests that worm creators are using worms for other objectives than simply infection, such as data theft and setting up denial of service networks.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong>Michelle Delio</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="amd00" href="/lib/amd00.html">You, Too, Can Write an Anna Worm</a>&raquo; <small>6.96Kb</small> <span class="note">12288 hits</span><br/><small>http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,41817,00.html (2001)</small><blockquote>The Anna Kournikova e-mail worm that whacked networks this week was not the work of a skilled cracker.

The worm reproduced itself and was received on an estimated 6,000 computer nodes worldwide. However, only a small percentage of these nodes actually executed the program. The computers that successfully ran the program would try to propagate the worm to other computer nodes.The worm was released onto the DECnet Intemet from a computer at a university in Switzerland. Within 10 minutes after it was released, the worm was detected on the Space Physics Analysis Network, or SPAN, which is NASA's largest space and Earth science network. Once the source program for the worm was captured, a procedural cure, using existing functionality of the computer operating systems, was quickly devised and distributed. A combination of existing computer security measures, the quick and accurate procedures devised to stop copies of the worm from executing, and the network itself, were used to rapidly provide the cure. These were the main reasons why the worm executed on such a small percentage of nodes.The purpose behind the worm was to send an electronic mall message to all users on the computer system running the worm. The message was a Christmas greeting and was signed "Father Christmas." This paper presents an overview of the analysis of the events concerning the worm based on an investigation that was made by the SPAN Security Team and provides some insight into future security measures that will be taken to handle computer worms and viruses that may hit similar networks in the future.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong>Harold Highland</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="ahh00" href="/lib/ahh00.html">A History Of Computer Viruses - Introduction</a>&raquo; <small>13.02Kb</small> <span class="note">12579 hits</span><br/><small>Computers & Security, Vol. 16, No. 5, pp.412-415 (1997)</small><blockquote>The following series of articles are taken from Harold's Computer Virus Handbook, published by Elsevier Advanced Technology in 1990.

The virus originated in Lahore, Pakistan, and spread rapidly from country to country through Europe and across to the North American Continent. In less than twelve months it had infected nearly a half-million computers and was causing minor havoc in hundreds of universities, corporations and government agencies.This virus, later dubbed the "Pakistani Brain", caught the user community unawares and the problems resulting from its many infections demonstrated how unprepared we were for this phenomenon. The computer systems targeted by the virus contained no specific hardware or software elements that could prevent or even slow its spread, and few utilities could even detect its presence after an infection occurrence. Fortunately, the virus was not destructive, and it limited its infections to floppy diskettes; avoiding hard disks entirely.The first defensive procedure developed to counteract this virus involved a simple visual inspection of a suspected diskette's volume serial label. The virus erased every infected diskette's volume label and replaced it with the character string - "@BRAIN". Thus, any inspection of the volume label, such as performing a simple DIRECTORY command, would indicate the presence or absence of the virus. An infected diskette could then be reformatted, or the virus could be removed by replacing the boot sector. This manual procedure is a typical, if somewhat rudimentary, example of the type of functions performed by a class of antiviral utilities commonly called Infection Identification products.Infection identification products generally employ "passive" techniques for virus detection. That is; they work by examining the virus in its inert state. This contrasts with active detection products which look for specific actions employed by a virus. For example, looking for a Format instruction within a segment of code on a disk would be a passive method of detecting a potentially destructive program. If we detected the Format attempt during program execution, however, we would be performing an active detection. Passive methods concern themselves with the static attributes of viruses, active methods concern themselves with the results of virus execution.Example active indicators are: the attempted erasure of critical files, destruction of the FAT table, re-direction of system interrupt vectors, general slowdown of the system, or an attempt to modify an executable program. These indicators are generic; that is, they are common to a large class of viruses. Because so many viruses perform these common activities, however, they are of little use in identifying individual virus strains. It is the passive virus indicators that prove most useful to a positive identification: The characteristic text imbedded within the virus, specific flags, singular filenames or a distinctive sequence of instructions that are unique to the virus. These and other similar indicators can best be ascertained by scanning system storage and examining the program files and other inert data.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong>Fridrik Skulason</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="afs00" href="/lib/afs00.html">The Search for Den Zuk</a>&raquo; <small>7.34Kb</small> <span class="note">12799 hits</span><br/><small><a href="/vx.php?fid=1678#f1678">Virus Bulletin, February 1991</a>, pp.7-8 (1991)</small><blockquote>The virus known as Den Zuk was discovered over two years ago, and infections have occasionally been reported since then.
