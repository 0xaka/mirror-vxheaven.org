<h2><a name="c1"></a>Intro</h2>
<p>In this article I would like to present you the way the NT based operating system handle DOS and 16-bit Windows programs. It is really interesting and the subsystem which takes care of this is really a Good Piece of Software (TM) :-)</p>
<p>You prolly tried to run some old apps or games on your NT box, sometimes you were succesfull, sometimes not. Why the hell doesn't my old good game run on my NT machine and by my friend on Win9x it does? you say maybe to yourself. Well NT operating system was designed with security in mind (yeah :-)). That means, that processes don't share their memory (at least the writeable part of it, with some exceptions of course), if one process crashes, it won't crash the entire operating system or different independent process. You don't have write access to the IDT thus you cannot easily get into ring0 and you cannot directly access I/O ports.</p>
<p>Since most DOS and 16-Bit Windows progs don't only use the defined DOS/Windows api but use nasty hacks that talk directly to the hardware and/or access different processe's memory they simply cannot run under Windows NT without violating one of it's main base stones. Thatswhy some kind of jailbox, a virtual machine, is used in Windows NT based operating systems.</p>
<h2><a name="c2"></a>NTVDM</h2>
<p>NTVDM stands for NT Virtual Dos Machine (surprisingly :-)) and is the name of the subsystem that consists of several parts spread from the kernel mode, user mode - in the normal Windows way of thinking - and the V86 mode in which DOS programs run (that don't use extenders). Let's take a deeper look at the components according to where they reside.</p>
<h3><a name="c21"></a>1) Kernel Mode parts</h3>
<p>The most visible part is the communication API that is exported via the NtVdmControl function which is mostly called by the Monitor (see later in this section). NtVdmControl handles things such as initializing environment for the virtual machine (since DOS/16-Bit Windows tasks run in the process context of ntvdm.exe - the Monitor - some memory has to be unmapped (for example the one that starts with 0 that handles null pointer touching), some needs to be mapped into the address space (like various BIOS section, that are taken from the real machine virtual machine runs on), destroying virtual machine, queing interrupts, direct printer port access and finally executing in v86 mode.</p>
<p>But the prolly main part of NTVDM are the trap handlers - Mainly numbers 06h and 0dh. The trap number 06h is used by the kernel components (DOS, 16-Bit Windows, DPMI) to transfer execution from virtual task to the Monitor using a special (undefined) opcode (0c4h, 0c4h) which is followed by params. The 0dh trap handles mainly direct access to the hardware (inX, outX) which is also dispatched to the Monitor.</p>
<p>These are the main kernel mode parts which can be found in ntoskrnl.exe.</p>
<h3><a name="c22"></a>2) User Mode parts</h3>
<p>The thing that assures that you're .com or 16-Bit .exe file gets runned is that CreateProcess searches for the way to run it. CreateProcess tries to find the subsystem (in cooperation with smss.exe) to which executable belongs. The function sooner or later realizes that the right thing to do is to run ntvdm.exe (if it is not already running - else the Win32 subsystem gets involved which sends "run new task" message to it, but depends on registry settings - if the virtual task must run in it's own ntvdm.exe/process, this won't happen) that will prepare environment for the virtual task execution and finally executes it.</p>
<p>Ntvdm.exe is really the Monitor. The routines in this prog handle all of the so called Bobs, ie provides the emulation layer. Ntvdm.exe is in fact SoftPC product from Insignia (you can find numerous strings in ntvdm.exe that proof this). SoftPC allows users of different architectures (like iMac) to run DOS and 16-Bit Windows programs. SoftPC also contains i386 emulation code, which doesn't get involved here, cause we're runned on i386 based box :-) (I am not sure, whether on NT boxes on Alphas is ntvdm.exe with i386 emulation present or is just void. If anyone knows, please drop me an email ...) The main loop of Monitor looks similar to this:</p>

<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #339933;">*</span> a_event<span style="color: black;">&#91;</span>event<span style="color: black;">&#93;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span><br/>

&nbsp;</div>
<p>That means that execution of the virtual task is in progess, until some event occures - may it be external event such as interrupt or event caused by the application - direct access to I/O ports, memory access to locations that are watched etc. Then the execution returns to the Monitor which processes the event and reenters the virtual task.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of the Bobs it's easy to provide an external interface for the developers to hook them. This is known as VDD - Virtual Device Drivers. The idea is to provide jailed DOS programs access to custom hardware. So the access from jailed virtual task looks as follows:</p>
<p>inX/outX/mem access from the virtual task -> Monitor -> VDD -> Native Windows NT driver</p>
<p>The basic functionality VDDs such as video card, mouse, keyboard etc are implemented in the bare ntvdm.exe.</p>
<h3><a name="c23"></a>3) The V86 parts</h3>
<p>If you look into your &lt;%system32%> directory on NT box you can notice various *.sys files that aren't native NT device drivers. They are the DOS drivers plus (nt)io.sys plus (nt)msdos.sys. There are also *.rom files that incorporate the BIOS code. If you all of this together, you'll get a one meg address space under which in V86 mode normal DOS programs run.</p>
<p>The question is - what happens if my DOS program calls some high-level function such as FileOpen via int 21h? First code in (nt)msdos.sys get's involved. It is an inter-layer between the Monitor and the virtual task. Sometimes it can handle function calls by it's own but most of the time it needs to somehow call the Monitor to provide emulation. Now syscall sequence (0c4, 0c4, ...) gets involved. If you open the (nt)msdos.sys file in your favourite hexa editor (mines hiew) and search for this sequence you'll find a lot of it. This is the way execution gets transfered - Bop gets dispatched. In the Monitor are the event handlers which for example use native win32 api calls for opening, reading and <em>whatever</em> with files. This is what I used when modified old *.com infector and named it WinNT.VDM :-)</p>
<p>But there also exist shortcuts. For example there's a sequence that doesn't transfer execution to the Monitor, but gets handled in the kernel mode (after the trap 06h handler recognizes it) - it is used for fast file read and write.</p>
<h2><a name="c3"></a>VdmQueryDirectoryFile</h2>
<p>One shortcut that has big influence on us, viral and rootkit coders is in NtVdmControl. While coding the NT rootkit we (Holy_Father and me) faced following problem: files could be seen under DOS programs even though we hooked NtQueryDirectoryFile. This is because the Monitor often uses function VdmQueryDirectoryFile which he invokes via NtVdmControl. Why? Possibly because it allows it to restart directory query from given index (it directly calls the filesystem code via IoCallDriver).</p>
<p>But it's not a problem to hook it. the ControlCode is #6 and the ControlData has structure similar to this</p>
<div class="c" style="font-family:monospace;color: #000066;  border: solid thin #c2c1b1; background: #d6d5c5;"><span style="color: #993333;">struct</span> CDATA<br/>
<span style="color: black;">&#123;</span><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DWORD Handle<span style="color: #339933;">;</span><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color: #993333;">void</span> <span style="color: #339933;">*</span>FileInformationBuffer<span style="color: #339933;">;</span><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br/>
<span style="color: black;">&#125;</span> cd<span style="color: #339933;">;</span><br/>
<br/>
called like NtVdmControl<span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color: #0000dd;">6</span><span style="color: #339933;">,</span><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color: #339933;">&amp;</span>cd<span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span><br/>
&nbsp;</div>
<p>on return the FileInformationBuffer is filled with datas having known FileBothDirectoryInformation structure so can be easily parsed and updated.</p>
<p>So if you are a ring3 or ring0 (using native api hooking, you won't need this when coding a filter) viral/rootkit coder, don't forget to become unseen for DOS task too :-)</p>
<h2><a name="c4"></a>Closing</h2>
<p>I tried to present a brief introduction to the NTVDM subsystem. Now explore on your own, this code is really worth it :-)</p>
<p>and as usual - if you found any nonaccuracy or maybe a bug in the text, don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
