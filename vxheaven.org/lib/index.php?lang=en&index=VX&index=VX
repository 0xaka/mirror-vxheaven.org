Maybe it's a primitive way of AI, who knows? First of all I have to say that this is just an idea, nothing more. The whole thing could be trash, but I don't hope/think so. Past showed us that everything is born out of an idea, and that is my the inspiration for writing this article. The article itself is 100% theoretically, no codeing examples, nothing but the explained idea.</blockquote>&laquo;<a name="vsp11" href="/lib/vsp11.html">Over-File Splitting</a>&raquo; <img src="/img/bin.gif" alt="[SRC]"/> <small>8.92Kb</small> <span class="note">11754 hits</span><br/><small><a href="/vx.php?fid=1413#f1413">Ready Rangers Liberation Front [6]</a> (2005)</small><blockquote>This title may give you no ideas what my idea is about, so I'll tell you: The idea itself is a heavy kind of Fuck-AV technique, it does not belong to any other technique I've already seen. Just check it out.Let's consider the detection of a virus by an AV program: The AV program searchs in all files of the disk for special strings or whatever.
