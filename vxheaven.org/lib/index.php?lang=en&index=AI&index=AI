This is due largely to the perception that machine language is computationally brittle (that is, working programs are a small fraction of the total of all possible programs and therefore a random change to a functional program will almost certainly render it non-functional). This assumes, however, that legitimate program sequences are dissimilar to each other and that "brittleness" does not exist in biological evolutionary systems. The first assumption was tested by checking for homology between legitimite program sequences at the machine level. A surprising degree of similarity was discovered, vastly above what would be expected if legitimate code sequences were only randomly related. The second assumption was examined via available data on protein mutations and composition. Although robust in some aspects, terrestrial biology also demonstrates significant brittleness. The difference in brittleness between computational and terrestrial systems therefore ceases to be a qualitative gap and becomes quantitative, albeit perhaps a large one. In light of the findings, some intriguing possibilities are examined. The evolution "in the wild" of computer viruses is considered and it is concluded that while evolution de novo is still unlikely, viable mutation of one virus strain to new species is possible. This explains a number of mutant viruses that have been discovered. Also considered is evolutionary computation using machine language as a possible optimisation tool, as is the significance of brittleness in evolutionary systems.</blockquote>&laquo;<a name="apa01" href="/lib/apa01.html">Computer Viruses: the Inevitability of Evolution?</a>&raquo; <img src="/img/sum.gif" alt="[TeX]"/> <small>29.11Kb</small> <span class="note">11760 hits</span><br/><small>First National Complexity Conference, Australian National University, Canberra, December 1992 (1992)</small><blockquote>In recent years computer viruses have received much attention although their theoretical aspects have been neglected. One such aspect is the possibility of viruses as life, with the attendant characteristics of terrestrial life forms including evolution. Where this particular idea has been previously considered, it has been judged highly improbable. The author disagrees and argues that viral evolution may not only be possible but inevitable. After an introduction to the biology of computer viruses evidence of viral evolution will be presented as well as examples of how current and future trends in computing could lead to the emergence of sophisticated and novel entities.

Most would agree that the reasoning behind this is to keep up with the arms race established between malware writers and the security community almost three decades ago. Still, malware writers have not as yet created new paradigms. Indeed, malicious code development is still largely limited to code pattern changes utilizing polymorphic and metamorphic engines, as well as executable packer and wrapper technologies. Each new malware instance retains the exact same core functionality as its ancestor and only alters the way it looks. What if, instead, malware were able to change its function or behaviour autonomously? What if, in the absence of human intervention, computer viruses resembled biological viruses in their ability to adapt to new defence technologies as soon as they came into effect? In this paper, we will provide the theoretical proof behind malware implementation that closely models Darwinian evolution.Biological viruses are under constant attack by immune systems and artificial drugs. Yet they systematically manage to evolve new functionalities that circumvent such countermeasures, leading to recurrent epidemics. According to the biological analogy, evolvable malware will be able to alter its functionality by autonomously incorporating behaviours freely available to it by the numerous discoverable APIs. The new behaviour profiles would constantly be screened by security software in the same way natural selection acts on biological organisms. In the end, the malware instances that are better equipped to survive counlermeasures will be able to proliferate more efficiently. Such malware poses a real threat to the current methods of detection due to the vast numbers of functions it can adopt, and that cannot possibly be screened for. Furthermore, it is likely that clean-program functionality will be favoured amongst such behaviours since it shields malware that is mimicking clean programs from behaviour blocking. As a consequence, we predict that behaviour-based virus detection would quickly become ineffective if malware can evolve based on the Darwinian paradigm.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong> J. S.

Naturally, there is no comparison in importance between real biological viruses and computer viruses, and i am not a "proponent" of the spreading of any kind, particularly in view of the tremendous damage and suffering that some biological viruses have caused to humans (see HIV, etc).

Simply because computer viruses do not existas organic molecules may not be sufficient reason to dismiss the classification of this form of "vandalware" as a form of life.This paper begins with a description of how computer viruses operate and their history, and of the various ways computer viruses are structured.

This meta-language and its implementation is presented in chapter 2.First experiments show very promising behaviour of the population. A statistically analyse of these population is done in chapter 3.

Based on this experience and by contrasting our work with computer viruses, we argue that Artiﬁcial Life (the simulation of life including evolution) can only remain reliably and indeﬁnitely cooperative if it adheres to explicitly-speciﬁed social conventions. Breaking or neglecting these conventions results in systems that are worse than useless; in fact, malicious with respect to human social values.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong> ValleZ</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="vva00" href="/lib/vva00.html">Genetic programming in virus</a>&raquo; <small>15.67Kb</small> <span class="note">9619 hits</span><br/><small><a href="/vx.php?fid=1224#f1224">29a [7]</a> (2004)</small><blockquote>I wanna comment here some ideas i have had.

REM is a program which replicates by copying itself, randomly changing one or more bytes in every offspring. After replicating, REM runs the offsprings, which should start replicating too. When an offspring is not able to replicate, it extincts.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong>Claus Wilke, Christoph Adami</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="mcw00" href="/lib/mcw00.html">The biology of digital organisms</a>&raquo; <small>37.34Kb</small> <span class="note">12884 hits</span><br/><small>Trends in Ecology & Evolution, Vol.17, No.11, pp. 528-532 (2002)</small><blockquote>Digital organisms are self-replicating computer programs that mutate and evolve. They can be thought of as a domesticated form of computer virus that lives in, and adapts to,a controlled environment.Digital organisms provide a unique opportunity with which to study evolutionary biology in a form of life that shares no ancestry with carbon-based life forms,and hence to distinguish general principles of evolution from historical accidents that are particular to biochemical life.In terms of the complexity of their evolutionary dynamics,digital organisms can be compared with biochemical viruses and bacteria.Recent studies of digital organisms have addressed long-term evolutionary adaptation and the growth of complexity in evolving systems,patterns of epistatic interactions in various genetic backgrounds,and quasi-species dynamics.</blockquote> <span class="note">16 authors, 20 titles</span></div>
