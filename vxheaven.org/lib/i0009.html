<p><strong>Hello Mark, thanks alot for acceppting the request to answere a few questions. Let's start first with something about your private life. How do you spend your free-time, what are your hobbies?? Which kind of music do you listen to?</strong></p>
<p>When not sitting in front of my computer, and/or working, I head to the outdoors as much as possible. I bike, hike, and recently started kayak fishing in the ocean. There's nothing quite like bobbing up and down in a kayak a mile offshore on a foggy day. And once in a while I actually catch a fish, although generally the fish are safe when I'm around.</p>
<p>As for music, I like the classic British Invasion bands (although I'm not <em>that</em> old), and especially The Kinks. I once attended two Kinks concerts on consecutive days, where I had to drive about 500 miles. Both of those concerts were in huge 10,000+ seat auditoriums, and for one of them, I was in the front row.</p>
<p><strong>When did you get first in contact with computers? When did you start to code for the first time? You started to study Computer Science in 1979 - why did you choose it and how was studying CS at that time?</strong></p>
<p>My high school had a couple of Commodore PET computers, and my dad had a TRS-80 that he wanted to use to automate some work in his accounting office. I spent a little time playing around with both of those, but I didn't really get excited about computers until we got an Intellivision game system. I still love to play those classic Intellivision games. Shortly thereafter, we got a Commodore 64 and I wrote a couple of fairly involved programs for that (a strategy-based football game and a horse racing animation). Then I was truly hooked.</p>
<p>Needless to say, CS education in the 1980s was a lot different than today. During college, I never heard the word "network" uttered, and nobody had a clue about security. Believe it or not, the computer system at my college had a password file that was stored in the clear, and everybody knew where it was located - essentially, there was no security at all. But, ironically, in some ways, I'd say that CS education was much better back in the "good old days". . . For one thing, we used "primitive" programming languages, such as C (no "++"). That type of programming forces a person to actually think and to be conscious of the hardware.</p>
<p>Today, almost all CS education relies on high-level object-oriented programming, where students are taught to tie a bunch of pre-defined crap together to accomplish their goal. To me, that's for wimps and, besides, it's mind-numbingly boring. And worst of all, the hardware is completely abstracted away, so students have no concept of the machine that is actually executing their code. When I tell my students that "everything is bits", they look at me like I'm from another planet (which I am, but don't tell anybody). IMHO, Java is the worst thing that ever happened to CS education, if not CS in general. A decent C program can be a work of art, while the best Java program in the world can't rise to that level. It's like comparing the Mona Lisa to a 5-year-old's finger-painting.</p>
<p>So maybe it's the "primitive" and low-level nature of security that attracts me. That sort of stuff gets short shrift in modern CS education, but is critical for understanding much of security. For example, to deal with malware, you have to deal with assembly code, reverse engineering, intricate details of PE file structure, etc., etc., etc. Of course, I have no doubt that eventually security education will become very bland and boring too, because all of that low-level stuff is unfashionable and hard. Then we'll have a lot more security "experts", but few of them will know anything useful.</p>
<p><strong>You have been working for the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1993-2000 as a Cryptologic Mathematician. Sounds interesting! Can you describe what you where doing? What were your responsibilities and how did your every-day look like?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. But seriously, I was a "cryptologic mathematician", so I did a lot of applied cryptanalysis. It was a fascinating experience, and I got to work with a lot of really, really smart people. I think I learned more about security in my 7 years at NSA than I could have learned in a lifetime anywhere else, especially when it comes to the offensive side. Most security that is done in industry and even academia is on the defensive side, but you can't expect people to play good defense unless they know a lot about the offense.</p>
<p><strong>What was your first encounter with computer viruses? When and why did you decide to work on this topic in your professional career?</strong></p>
<p>I'm interested in all aspects of information security, from cryptography to software reverse engineering, and everything in between. But, I didn't have much experience with malware when I started working at SJSU. At SJSU, I have a lot of master's students and I'm always looking for appropriate project topics. Ideally, a master's project has some academic substance, yet it has a practical angle to it, and it's do-able within the limited timeframe of a master's degree (basically, two semesters of part-time research). I had one excellent student who wanted to do something in security, but with a bioinformatics flavor. I've long had an interest in hidden Markov models (HMMs), and metamorphic malware had recently caught my attention. We combined the two and got some interesting results, and my work in malware has grown exponentially from there.</p>
<p><strong>Which computer viruses do you find most interesting? Which ideas/techniques do you find surprising/creative?</strong></p>
<p>I'm fascinated by metamorphic malware, that is, malware that "mutates" each generation by changing its internal structure, while the function remains the same. In principle, metamorphism is an extremely powerful technique for evading signature detection. In fact, you can easily prove that metamorphic malware can evade signature detection. The concept of metamorphism has been around for quite a while, but virus writers have not (yet) been able to really take advantage of the full potential. Our research highlights some of the challenges in developing such malware and we also focus on the interplay between practical detection and evasion strategies.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about hobby-viruswriters who discover/develope new techniques and release the source-code of their creations online? In several of your researches you use for instance <a href="/vx.php?id=tn02">NGVCK</a> by SnakeByte, who publicly released this complex virus construction kit. Do you think this is a problem as other people could use it for harmful malware? Have you ever had contact to SnakeByte or other hobby-viruswriters?</strong></p>
<p>"I think any time you expose vulnerabilities it's a good thing. . ." is a quote attributed to Janet Reno, Attorney General in the Clinton administration. Of course, she didn't act accordingly, but that quote summarizes my philosophy, with respect to malware. If we didn't have people constantly probing for new attack vectors, we'd all be a lot less secure today.</p>
<p>My students have spent a lot of time and effort analyzing virus construction kits that claim to produce metamorphic code. We've found them to be generally weak, with very little metamorphism in the resulting code. The exception to that rule is NGVCK, by SnakeByte, which achieves an high level of metamorphism. It turns out that NGVCK is still detectable with our HMM technique, but that's pretty far beyond standard signature detection. So, NGVCK has figured prominently in a lot of my students' research. I have had a couple of email correspondences with SnakeByte, and I let him (or her) know that I am impressed by his (or her) work.</p>
<p><strong>In several publications by you or thesis by your students, you explain implementations of complex mutation engines. Why haven't you released the source codes? Have you shared the source codes with other security researchers or even anti virus companies?</strong></p>
<p>So far, we have not shared the code, but the ideas have been published and it would not be difficult to reproduce most of what we've done. Also, with rare exception, for our research projects, we do not need all of the bells and whistles that would be required in a fully functional metamorphic generator. That is, our contribution resides in the ideas and quantifiable results, rather than the generators themselves.</p>
<p><strong>You have shown that your method of hidden-Markov-Model (HMM) can be used to detect complex metamorphic viruses via a statistical approach. However, recently in the article "Hunting for undetectable metamorphic viruses" you showed a way to circumvent HMM-detection, for instance by including "normal-file" code to the viruscode. How could the next step from a defender's side look like?</strong></p>
<p>That's a very good question. There are several possible approaches that could aid detection, and some of these are under investigation by my current students. For example, if we can detect and remove a reasonable percentage of dead code (and/or other "unimportant" code), then we can detect the viruses in the paper you've cited. We've got some ideas on how to do that. Of course, virus writers could respond by making their dead code stealthier, or in various other ways that would make separating the wheat from the chaff more difficult. But, anything we do to make the virus writer's life more difficult will increase the chances of some flaw or weakness slipping by, and that should leave us with a viable detection strategy. If you think about it, most physical security operates on exactly this same principle. That is, if a perfect crime occurs, you'll never catch the perpetrator. But, the more perfect that the crime has to be, the less likely the perpetrator will succeed. In other words, we make our defenses as strong as possible and then rely on the fact that (near) perfection is extremely difficult to achieve. As in the physical world, people who expect absolute information security are likely to be disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have contact with anti virus companies? Are they interested in your research in statistical detection methods of complex viruses or do they ignore results from scientific researches?</strong></p>
<p>We have met with AV companies in the past and they seem to like to hire my former students. But I haven't had any close dealings with any of those companies for the past few years. I won't mention any names, but based on my experience (which is now a few years out of date) I'd say the AV companies are (were) fairly primitive in their approach. They relied almost entirely on manual analysis - when a new virus appeared, they'd have a skilled reverse engineer beat his head against it until a signature could be derived. That skilled reverse engineer is certainly important, but there are a lot of tools and powerful techniques that could be brought to bear on the problem. I suspect that it's simply a matter of their approach working, so they have no need to push the envelope. But I'm confident that the problems are going to get more difficult in the future, and then we'll see if the AV companies are up to the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>It is known since the 1980s that malware detection is undecidable (which has been proven by Fred Cohen already in the 1980s). Yet people from anti-virus community claim that every self-replicator can be detected. Now what is correct? Could somebody write a self-modifying virus that can circumvent every possible methode like clever algorithms, emulation including behaviour analysis, statistical approaches, ...?</strong></p>
<p>In spite of the theoretical result that you mention, it seems that viruses are generally detected with surprising ease. I believe this has more to do with the poor quality of most malware code, as opposed to affirming the genius of AV software. Certainly, much of what the AV people do is excellent, but, in principle, the virus writers should always have the upper hand, and that does not seem to be the case in practice. I think the relative weakness of typical hacker-produced malware is exposed when compared to something like Stuxnet, which takes malware to a completely different level.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://vxheaven.org/">VX Heavens</a> has been closed since March 2012, due prosecution of herm1t. In many of your articles you cite/reference to VX Heavens or its content. What were your thoughts when this virus-related library was closed? VX Heavens exists for many years, why did they investigate against herm1t now? Has the shutdown influenced the research of scientists like yourself?</strong></p>
<p>This is a significant loss to the virus research community. There are certainly many academic researchers who have gotten access to viruses through VX Heavens. And, as always, there is no putting the genie back in the bottle. So, these absurd legal proceedings will cause headaches for everybody, possibly make a few lawyers rich, and ultimately, accomplish nothing useful.</p>
<p><strong>About two years ago, Stuxnet appeared and marked the first big publicly-known cyber-attack of a government. Later Duqu, Flame and Gauss were discovered. What do you think about these cyber weapons? Where you surprised about attacks of this type and these code's complexity? What were the reasons that these codes have been actively spreading and no anti virus program was able to detect it?</strong></p>
<p>Stuxent is amazing - far more sophisticated than any malware previously seen in the wild. Any time an attacker has a zero day exploit (or 2 or 3) available, the AV ought to have trouble, at least until the system is patched. So, I'd cut the AV guys some slack on this one. As for the use of cyber weapons, I think that was inevitable. It's hard to say where it might lead, but it's not hard to imagine some pretty unpleasant scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think will the future of computer viruses look like? What do you expect in a near future 3-5 years from now? And how might self-replicating codes might be in a distant future 15-20years from now?</strong></p>
<p>As I always tell my students, the future is bright for malware. We know that in theory, it's not possible to detect all malware. So, malware writers should have an inherent advantage. Sometimes, however, the line between theory and practice can be a lot less clear than the theoreticians would have you believe. For example, the traveling salesman problem is a classic NP-complete problem, which means there is no known efficient algorithm to solve it. But that's not the end of the story - there are very efficient algorithms that give good approximates in practice. So, practical malware detection and theoretical detection might be quite different beasts. Having said that, it seems almost certain that malware will remain a difficult practical challenge for the foreseeable future. Just a couple of years ago, something like Stuxnet would have been hard to imagine. Now, thanks to Stuxnet, run-of-the-mill viruses are bound to become much stronger, and, as for the next generation of super-viruses, the sky is the limit.</p>
