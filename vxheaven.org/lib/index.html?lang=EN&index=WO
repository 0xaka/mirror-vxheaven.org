Bowden, the best-selling author of Black Hawk Down, has delivered a dramatic cybercrime story that explores the Conficker computer worm, a potentially devastating computer virus that has baffled experts and infected as many as twelve million computers to date.When the Conficker computer worm was unleashed on the world in November 2008, cybersecurity experts did not know what to make of it. The worm, exploiting the security flaws in Microsoft Windows, grew at an astonishingly rapid rate, infecting millions of computers around the world within weeks. Once the worm infiltrated one system it was able to link that system with others to form a single network under illicit outside control—a situation known as a “botnet.” This botnet was soon capable of overpowering any of the vital computer networks that today control banking, telephone service, energy flow, air traffic, health-care information—even the Internet itself. Was it a platform for criminal profit, or a weapon? Security experts do not know for sure what Conficker’s purpose is, or even where it came from.Bowden’s book reports this new frontier on terror in a way that has never been done. He skillfully explores the dazzling battle of wits between expert programmers over the future of the Internet—a battle that has pitted those determined to exploit the Internet against those committed to protect it, and awakened the U.S. government for the first time to the urgent nature of the threat. In Worm: The Story of the First Digital World War, Mark Bowden delivers an accessible and fascinating look at the ongoing and largely unreported war taking place literally beneath our fingertips.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong>Mark Eichin, Jon Rochlis</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="aem02" href="/lib/aem02.html">With Microscope and Tweezers: An Analysis of the Internet Virus of November 1988</a>&raquo; <small>139.28Kb</small> <span class="note">10467 hits</span><br/><small>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1989)</small><blockquote>In early November 1988 the Internet, a collection of networks consisting of 60,000 host computers implementing the TCP/IP protocol suite, was attacked by a virus, a programwhich broke intocomputers on the network and which spread from one machine to another.

Existing malware propagation models mainly concentrate on malware epidemic consequences modeling, i.e. forecasting the number of infected computers, simulating malware behavior or economic propagation aspects and are based only on current malware propagation strategies. Significant research has been done in the world during the last years to fight the Internet worms. In this article we propose the extension to our genetic algorithm based model, which aims at Internet worm propagation strategies modeling under pressure of countermeasures. Genetic algorithm is selected as a modeling tool taking into consideration the efficiency of this method while solving optimization and modeling problems with large solution space.

Virus information repositories, such as the Network Associates' Virus Information Library, contain over 4500 different entries (through the first quarter of 2003). While many of these entries are interesting, a great number of them are now simply historical and a large percentage of them are completely derivative in nature. However, these virus information repositories are the best source of material on the breadth of malicious code, including worms.This paper is meant to provide worm researchers with a high-level roadmap to the vast body of virus and worm information. After sifting through hundreds of entries, we present only those that we considered breakthrough or novel, primarily from a technical perspective. As a result, we found ourselves omitting some of the most notorious worms simply because they lacked any original aspects. It is our hope that others in the community who need to get up to speed in the worm literature can benefit from this survey. While this study does not contain any original research, it provides an overview of worms using a truly breadth-first approach, which has been lacking in the existing worm literature.From this raw data, we have also extracted a number of broad quantitative and qualitative trends that we have found to be interesting. We believe that a workshop discussion of these, and other thoughts, will be engaging and informative.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong>Carey Nachenberg</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="acn00" href="/lib/acn00.html">Computer Parasitology</a>&raquo; <small>96.5Kb</small> <span class="note">11692 hits</span><br/><small>Proceedings of the Ninth International Virus.

The book helps you understand the classifications and groupings of worms, and offers a deeper understanding of how they threaten network and system security.After examining how a worm is constructed and how its major life cycle steps are implemented, the book scrutinizes targets that worms have attacked over the years, and the likely targets of the immediate future. Moreover, this unique reference explains how to detect worms using a variety of mechanisms, and evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of three approaches—traffic analysis, honeypots and dark network monitors, and signature analysis. The book concludes with a discussion of four effective defenses against network worms, including host-based defenses, network firewalls and filters, application layer proxies, and a direct attack on the worm network itself.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong> One Semicolon</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="vos00" href="/lib/vos00.html">Techniques a worm might use to be harder to locate</a>&raquo; <img src="/img/bin.gif" alt="[SRC]"/> <small>37.64Kb</small> <span class="note">10834 hits</span><br/><small> (2002)</small><blockquote>This paper will discuss different things a worm might do in the future.

Morris, its author, are also discussed.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong> SPTH</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="vsp34" href="/lib/vsp34.html">Wikipedia: Using free knowlegde for bad stuff</a>&raquo; <img src="/img/bin.gif" alt="[SRC]"/> <small>11.25Kb</small> <span class="note">9085 hits</span><br/><small><a href="/vx.php?fid=1512#f1512">Ready Rangers Liberation Front [7]</a> (2005)</small><blockquote>Many people know about the Interactive Disassembler. It is a great tool for disassembling many different file formats for many different CPUs. It even has a debugger now, so it can be used for all kinds of reverse-engineering, unpacking, decrypting, etc. In case that was not enough functionality, it also supports a language called IDC. In the words of Ilfak, IDC language is a C-like language. It has the same lexical tokens as C does: character set, constants, identifiers, keywords, etc. A program in IDC consists of function declarations.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong> WarGame</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="vwg02" href="/lib/vwg02.html">Writing irc worms for xchat2</a>&raquo; <img src="/img/bin.gif" alt="[SRC]"/> <small>4.92Kb</small> <span class="note">11777 hits</span><br/><small> (2007)</small><blockquote></blockquote><div class="l1"><strong>Nicholas Weaver, Vern Paxson</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="anw02" href="/lib/anw02.html">A Worst-Case Worm</a>&raquo; <img src="/img/sum.gif" alt="[TeX]"/> <small>46.24Kb</small> <span class="note">11137 hits</span><br/><small> (2004)</small><blockquote>Worms represent a substantial economic threat to the U.S. computing infrastructure. An important question is how much damage might be caused, as this figure can serve as a guide to evaluating how much to spend on defenses. We construct a parameterized worst-case analysis based on a simple damage model, combined with our understanding of what an attack could accomplish. Although our estimates are at best approximations, we speculate that a plausible worst-case worm could cause $50 billion or more in direct economic damage by attacking widely-used services in Microsoft Windows and carrying a highly destructive payload.</blockquote><div class="l1"><strong>Nicholas Weaver, Vern Paxson, Stuart Staniford, Robert Cunningham</strong></div>&laquo;<a name="anw01" href="/lib/anw01.html">A Taxonomy of Computer Worms</a>&raquo; <small>45.5Kb</small> <span class="note">13515 hits</span><br/><small>Proceedings of the 2003 ACM Workshop on Rapid Malcode (WORM), 2003. pp.11-18 (2003)</small><blockquote>To understand the threat posed by computer worms, it is necessary to understand the classes of worms, the attackers who may employ them, and the potential payloads.

A worm is a computer program which copies itself from computer to computer in an attempt to reproduce as much as possible. A superworm uses more advanced techniques to achieve very quick infection of the network. The primary strategy behind the Warhol superworm is to pre-scan the network for vulnerable targets. When the worm is launched it already has a large list of targets with a known method for infection and can therefore quickly infect an initial seed population.One thing which the Warhol paper mentions is that better results might be achieved via a coordinated worm in which various instances of the worm on different computers communicate with each other in order to optimize infection. The Warhol paper states, however, that no coordinated worm has ever been created. This paper proposes the first design for a worm which utilizes efficient communication between worm instances for an optimal infection strategy.</blockquote> <span class="note">23 authors, 23 titles</span></div>
