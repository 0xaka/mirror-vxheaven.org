Do you think that you are going to scare the Russian government by defacing the Kremlin&#039;s website or that you are protecting Ukraine by doing so?</p></blockquote></div><p>Defaces just attract an attention. Real work is stolen information. Arms trafficking, enlistment of armed insurgents within Russia and Ukraine, military and civil orders, bank transactions including financing of terrorism, illegal trade and money laundering. There are no people behind &quot;people republics&quot;, every decision was made by Moscow. The leaked info could and sometimes do break their plans on further destabilization of the country, and, yes, it (not defaces) scares them. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>Cali wrote:</cite><blockquote><p>I know dozens of people who have lost their home and workplace, for some it&#039;s the pro-russia that just seized their places or the shells from Kiev that destroyed their building.</p></blockquote></div><p>The very same people lives in Kharkiv and Dnipro, and there is no war there. There are no crucial differences between eastern regions but Russia was able to orchestrate so called &quot;civil war&quot; only in two of them.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>I have not seen any tank in Kiev, neither has any shell dropped on my head. If Russia wanted to annex Ukraine, let&#039;s be honest, that would be a matter of a day or two. What both parties want is a conflict that can be used as a business buffer zone. And as of now, it seems to be working well.</p></blockquote></div><p>I talked about separatists dreams to move on. Yes, Russia could enter Kiev in a week, may be two, but there would be no chance for them to leave. They will face armed, political and economical response, and though they have large army it would&nbsp; be a hollow victory.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>So you&#039;ve defaced a website to put a Ukrainian flag or some video of you with a Guy Fawkes mask. The website will be restored the next day with the security flaw patched and you won&#039;t be able to deface it again. As a result you have made a free ad campaign for this site. I also used to do that in my teenage years, sometimes it was fun, but did it help changing anything in the world? Certainly not.</p></blockquote></div><p>Certainly, we did. What about several uncovered spy networks? All discovered agents were arrested or forced to flee. And this is just a small episode in a series.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>As for disclosing their names, most of them don&#039;t even hide. And if you&#039;re talking about simple soldiers, they are plenty of them uploading their information to social networks.</p></blockquote></div><p>What about FSB, GRU, russian career military, russian organized crime, russian government pumping in money?<br />They too have nothing to hide, haven&#039;t them?</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>We need a state of liberties and democracy, only then people in the Donbass and Crimea could take a stand for Ukraine.</p></blockquote></div><p>First of all we need the state. Would you like to build democracy in DPR? What about liberties in Luhansk? Civil rights and effective state is a goal. But you cannot build democracy in the war zone, and nobody, nowhere and never was able to &quot;just stop a war&quot;, you could either win or loose. So, there are priorities: 1) we must stop aggression 2) we should not forget about the reason for being in a state of war.</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><p>If you&#039;re interested in I.T, I would invite you to rather join working groups to protect Ukraine&#039;s open, decentralized and censorship-free Internet. Right now there are thugs from American lobbies, calling Ukrainian Internet users &quot;thieves&quot; that are trying to activate a state censorship and laws against sharing and freedom of speech, are you doing something against it?</p></blockquote></div><p>I am strongly opposed to any forms of censorship, but now I have other things to do. (and, though I don&#039;t like the idea of IP, but for example ex.ua or other similar services are not about the freedom of speech)</p>]]></content>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p><p>Why do you care about Russia? Don&#039;t you think there is enough shit in what&#039;s left of Ukraine? Don&#039;t you think that we should build Ukraine first?</p><p>I&#039;ve been living in both Russia and Ukraine and I can tell that you can&#039;t defend any of the two now. Both Russian and Ukrainian governments attack their own citizens. Nationalism in Ukraine has turned ultimately retarded so did Russian nationalism in Russia.</p><p>People who visit Ukraine will notice that everybody speaks Russian and even in the eastern parts where people are accustomed to use Ukrainian they can all perfectly understand and speak Russian.</p><p>The current government got into power thanks to extremists being very close to the ideology of the 3rd Reich, it&#039;s just as bad as in Russia.</p><p>People in Donetsk don&#039;t give a fuck about Ukraine, neither are people in Crimea. You just have to be very naive that your situation will get better by building close ties with Russia but whatever it is,&nbsp; people there don&#039;t want Ukraine. But who actually, could have sympathy for an Ukraine that does not respect freedoms of individuals?<br />The fake revolts which happened in Ukraine are much more responsible for the lost of territories. Russian just steers up the conflict.</p><p>I believe in Ukraine in the sense that I think, one day we could have a truly democratic and sovereign country which respects freedom of individuals, this starts by respecting the oppinions of people, even if you don&#039;t like these opinions and the languages people speak, but for this we need not only to resist Russia, but also the European Union, the USA and even the local powers. Cause none of them is actually really democratic, none of them are defending essential values, it&#039;s just about business.</p><p>Only when this happens, we could make people in Donetsk and Crimea realize that they have been sodomized. Throwing bombs on them or calling them terrorists will never help.</p><p>Our offices have been attacked by thugs from the SBU (ex-KGB), they stole our hardware and attempted to make false evidences. This never happened when the previous shitty government was in place.</p><p>So let&#039;s clean the shit at our doorstep and forget about Russia unless you actually want to turn Ukraine into nazi germany with no culture, no education and no freedom and worst: no sovereighty. Either you give the sovereighty of Ukraine to Russia or the European Union, it will be the same shit.</p><p>Wasting your time in so called script-kiddie &quot;cyberwar&quot;, with guy fawkes masks just help ridiculing Ukraine worldwide.</p>]]></content>
